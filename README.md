# SRM-Medical-Store-Management-System
The SRM Medical Store Management
System project report contains the important methods and details in creating
the project. The most important of which is to centralize the data
administration and accessibility. The ADMIN will be able to input, maintain and
access the medicine details, customer details, and about billings data more
simply. The customers can have an overview about the medicine before
purchasing. The pharmacy management system
serves many purposes, including the safe and effective dispensing of pharmaceutical
drugs. During the dispensing process, the system will prompt the pharmacist
to verify the medication they have filled is for the correct patient, contains
the right quantity and dosage, and displays accurate information on the
prescription label. Advanced pharmacy management systems offer clinical
decision support and may be configured to alert the pharmacist to perform
clinical interventions, such as an opportunity to offer verbal counseling if
the patient's prescription requires additional education in the pharmacy.

Medical Store management systems
should also serve the pharmacist throughout the Pharmacists’ Patient Care
Process.

The SRM Medical store system software is a
medicine stock inventory system used in SRM medical stores that runs for the
students and the faculties. This software stores the details of medicine
purchase stock and the sell stock. The system should maintain purchase stock
detail by company wise and sell stock detail by customer wise. Here the
customer is the SRM students and faculties. This software should generate an auto-mated
bill for every selling and generate reports for stock, sell, and customer
detail
